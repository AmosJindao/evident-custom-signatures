# Description:
# Ensure no customer managed IAM policy that allows full admin privilege (CIS-01-24)
#
# IAM policies are the means by which privileges are granted to users, groups, or roles. It is
# recommended and considered a standard security advice to grant the least privilegeâ€”that is,
# granting only the permissions required to perform a task.
#
#
# Default Conditions:
# - PASS: IAM policy does not have full admin (*:*) access
# - WARN: IAM policy has full admin access, but has no attachment
# - FAIL: IAM policy has full admin access and attached to user/group/role
#
# Resolution/Remediation:
# Customer created IAM policies that have a statement with
#   "Effect": "Allow" with 
#   "Action": "" over 
#   "Resource": "" 
# should be removed.
